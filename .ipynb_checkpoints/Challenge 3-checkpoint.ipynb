    "# Explaination\n",
    "### Defining the method\n",
    "To start off, we give the method the name `boxPlots` it is descriptive enough for me and easy to type.\n",
    "#### The parameters\n",
    "    - df:       The dataframe used to visualize the features\n",
    "    - features: A Tuple of the features wanting to be analysed\n",
    "    - label:    The string of which column is the label\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def boxPlots(df, features, label):\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Checking the amount of features present\n",
    "If we have more than 4 features we want to split them up in to multiple sets of 4. This is why we do an initial check to see if we have more than 4 features.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if(len(features)>4):\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Printing the boxplots by 4\n",
    "If there are more features than 4 we want to split these into groups of 4 and print them seperately.\n",
    "First, we make a loop by deviding the amount of features by 4 and adding 1. The `int()` method **ALWAYS** rounds downwards and this is not good for us as the last features will be cut off. This is the reason we add 1.\n",
    "Second, we want to try plotting all 4 figures at once, if this fails it is most likely an index out of range exception. To make sure all boxplots get plotted we then again implement a try in the catch to plot every single boxplot after one another.\n",
    "This isn't the most clean way to do it but it works.\n",

    "        for i in range(int(len(features)/4)+1):\n",
